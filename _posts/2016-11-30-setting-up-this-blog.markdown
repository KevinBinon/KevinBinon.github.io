#Steps to setup this Blog

2 weeks ago I heard about the GitHub project GitHub Pages. This project serves a static website bound to your GitHub account.

My colleague [https://bktid.github.io]bktid posted about his adventure and how he did his setup.
He mentioned some experimental setup, which included installing chocolatey and ruby on windows.
I did give it a try and I succeeded! :smile:
